In birds, the conspicuous flashings (particularly on the underside of the wings) are very likely to serve this function. Many birds, on sighting a ground predator, fly a small distance to a safer vantage point from where they view the predator. As a wader flock (especially of knot, Calidris canuta) is approached, some individuals often raise their wings (showing the conspicuous bars); as the observer approaches even closer, the flock takes flight.",no,b,"In addition, two areas of flash coloration were recognized: (i) wing bars, rump and outer tail feathers, and (ii) underside of wings and underside of tail. The reason for lumping the 'flash' regions of the body in these particular combinations was that wing bars, rump, and outer tail feathers are visible from the side, rear and above as soon as the bird prepares for take-off. In contrast, the underside of the wings and tail are seen from beneath when the bird is already in the air, or perhaps from the front as the bird comes in to land.

The foreleg femora are black on the inner surface, and the ventral surface of the thorax is crimson, suggesting that these colours may possibly have significance in some display, but no display was ever seen. They are unlikely to be flash colours since they are not easily visible when the mantis moves.",no,t,"In female Danuria, however, the insect is so elongated and comparatively feeble in appearance that raising the wings does not increase its apparent size to any marked extent. In this case, the display simply involves sudden exposure of bright colours which then vanish quickly so that the display is more in the nature of a flash. Although I have not been able to examine a healthy Leptocola, its wing pattern is such that I consider it probable that it too has a startle display involving sudden opening and closing of the wings. Obviously the importance of such a startle display involving a quick flash of colour or of eyespots can only succeed if the insect then becomes cryptic again, and this sort of display only occurs in species with elaborate primary defence.",no,b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hypothesized that flash displays may also function to frighten or surprise predators, causing them to abandon or be unsuccessful in their pursuit (Murali, 2018). These displays can be seen in the colorful underwings of a variety of moths, namely sphingid and noctuid moths, as well as the hindwings of some orthopterans, mantids, and cicadas (Loeffler_Henry, Kang, & Sherratt, 2019).

In the case of flash marks, the colour signal is not continuously visible and is used by diurnal and nocturnal animals for sexual signalling or predator avoidance. In birds, such flashing coloration is associated with sexual selection processes or with flocking behaviour, either to confuse predators or to coordinate flying43. In butterflies, flash marks are thought to confuse predators and in amphibians, similar to grasshoppers, flash marks or flash colours, have been associated with acute escape behaviour, deimatism and territoriality41. For example, the brilliant-thighed poison frog, Allobates femoralis, possesses inguinal red-orange to yellow colour patches that become visible when they make quick, long jumps during escape. This behaviour and type of colour signal can best be described by what Edmunds3 labelled “flash behaviour”. This behaviour falls in the context of deimatism; a ‘startle’ display that triggers a reflexive response in the predator to a sudden sensory input44. In the case of Allobates femoralis this works by irritating the attacker with a sudden colour signal, but hiding the colour and staying motionless after jumping away, consequently, inhibiting prey detection. Moreover, Toledo and Haddad26 describe flash colour behaviour in the nocturnal, arboricolous genera Hypsiboas and Scinax. Here, again, the colour signal is visible during movement but concealed during resting posture, protecting them from attacks during the day whilst resting. Both Toledo and Haddad26 as well as Hödl and Amézquita41 mention a potential aposematic function of flash colours. The red feet of A. spumarius sensu lato differ from the examples above by being displayed independently from the presence of predators or conspecifics, and by being displayed by diurnal animals. Furthermore, other amphibians display flash colours for a short instance, whereas the red feet in A. spumarius sensu lato become visible repeatedly and during slow movement. This enables the predator to follow and process the signal, indicating a function other than confusion or short-term hesitation in order to escape. Moreover, both male and female Atelopus possess the signal where present.",various,"b, t",no,no,no,yes,"the brilliant-thighed poison frog, Allobates femoralis, possesses inguinal red-orange to yellow colour patches that become visible when they make quick, long jumps during escape.
