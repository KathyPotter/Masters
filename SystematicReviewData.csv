Cott, in his work "" Adaptive in Animals"" (1940), devoted several pages and many figures to this 'flash coloration'...In this tubular depression, the female rests, almost perfectly camouflaged by the similarity of colour to the lichens which grow on the tree. If the spider is disturbed, however, a vivid red streak shoots down the trunk, as it jumps and lowers itself on a thread. The red streak stops as it alights further down the trunk with the underside of the abdomen covered. It is very difficult to follow the later part of this movement, owing to the rapid colour change. Many members of the EretJidre, which retreat into their tube-like web endings when disturbed, jump when further attacked, and the same effect is produced by the highly coloured underside of the abdomen; It would appear that this colour change would once again offer protection against a foe attacking at close range.""",0,0,"no procrypsis, close range ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,,,,,,,,,,1945,Nature,Journal,Animal Concelament and Flash Coloration,invertebrates,,0,,no,0,0,0,,no,0,0,1,US,Cott 1940,1,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,no,0,0,yes,no,b,no,no,no,1,0

"Bidau, C.

Having startled the intruder, insects probably can escape before the predator reacts. Examples of Orthopterans having this response are: the New Zealand weta Deinacrida heteracantha White, 1842, the tettigoniids Neobarrettia spinosa (Caudell, 1907) (Litroscelidinae) from Mexico, the predatory Clonia multispina Uvarov, 1942 (Saginae) from eastern Africa, and Balboana tibialis (Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1895) from Central America and Colombia (Robinson 1968; Kaltenbach 1990; Mathews & Mathews 2010). In other cases, orthopterans may use flash colouration, as is the case of Acripeza reticulata Guérin-Méneville, 1832, an Australian katydid (Phaneropterinae) which is erroneously called 'Mountain Grasshopper' (Rentz 2010). The species lives in leaf litter and it has a grayish exterior appearance that makes it cryptic to predators. However, if disturbed, females raise their wings and show a brilliant black, blue and red colour pattern (Mathews & Mathews 2010). Flash colouration in reverse also occurs in some cryptic grasshoppers [e. g., lubber grasshoppers (Romaleidae) and band-winged grasshoppers (Acrididae, Oedipodinae)] which while on flight display colourful wings but when they settle their exterior matches the ground colour (Mathews & Mathews 2010).",0,0,"D, ASP",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Argentina,,,,,,,,,,2014,Journal of Insect Biodiversity,Journal,Patterns in Orthoptera biodiversity.

In most cases movement by a resting butterfly will tend to attract a searching predator and so diminish the effectiveness of crypsis. Since daytime activity is necessary for reproductive success in butterflies there must, for species which are generally camouflaged, be some balance between effective crypsis at rest and a breakdown of crypsis during spells of activity...If crypsis is not successful in overcoming the prey recognition of a searching predator then some butterflies may have a second line of defence which can be effective even if they are unaware ot the predator and cannot or do not escape by flight...More fully differentiated and larger eyespots are often hidden at rest They may be suddenly or quickly exposed on disturbance. startling or confusing a predator and causing it to withdraw (Blest 1957; Coppinger 1970) Some Lepidoptera show this type of 'flash' display associated with patches of bright colour rather than eyespots. though large eyespots are frequently associated with bright patches of colour.",0,0,"D, protean",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,UK,"Shreeve, T.","Thomas, J.

The young, however, are quite soft because the carapace never completely ossifies in this species and are bright reddish orange on the undersurface of the fleshy parts and plastron. The bright colors are lost at a carapace length of about 3 inches, the shell is ossified considerably over the juvenile condition, and the jaws have developed sufficiently to deliver a respectable bite. The vocal behavior is also apparently dropped at this point. No specimen over 3 inches (N = 11) was ever heard vocalizing, while all individuals under that length (N = 4) could be induced to do so.

"Capinera, J.

A startle response can be achieved by flash coloration, whereby the insect quickly produces a flash of color that was not exposed previously. This is common in moths (Lepidoptera) and grasshoppers (Orthoptera), and may startle the predator long enough to allow the prey to hop or fly away. Also, appendage extension, either of the legs or wings, can be used to make the insect appear larger, and perhaps frighten the predator. This is common among grasshoppers, katydids and wetas (all Orthoptera). Exposure of eye spots, or the appearance of large, false eyes on the wings of moths (Fig. 4.17) or the body of caterpillars not only serves to produce a flash of color, but perhaps to startle a predator into thinking that the prey is a well-defended reptile rather than a nearly defenseless insect.",0,0,"D startle, warning",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,USA,,,,,,,,,,2010,Insects and Wildlife: Arthropods and their relationships with wild vertebrate animals,Book,Flight and startle behavior,invertebrates,,0,,no,0,0,0,,no,0,0,1,US,no,1,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,no,0,0,yes,no,b,yes,no,b,1,0

"Caro, T.",no,"Conspicuous coloration in animals has many possible functions including signaling to conspecifics, or predator deterrence through confusion, intimidation, and duping; the last includes flash behavior where predators are deceived into looking for conspicuous cues exhibited in flight but that are hidden when the animal comes to rest...Examining those artiodactyls that can facultatively expose color patches (putative flash behavior), we discovered that this trait occurred in artiodactyls that are solitary or living in very small groups irrespective of their body size. It is therefore possible that species such as white- and black-tailed deer, which display white rumps and tails during pursuit but hide them when stationary, are using flash behavior to confuse the predator into looking for the wrong object and thereby avoid detection and suggests that this form of antipredator defense in mammals needs greater attention...These species may expose conspicuous patches during flight but hide them at rest fooling the predator into searching for the wrong object, a relatively newly researched defense mechanism called flash behavior...Examples of such dynamic antipredator mechanisms include deimatism where conspicuous body parts may startle the predator and slow attack (Umbers et al. 2017), intimidate the predator and thereby halt attack (O’Hanlon et al. 2018), facilitate predator education (Kang et al. 2016), confuse the predator (Palleroni et al. 2005), are pursuit deterrent advertisements of prey’s unprofitability (Ramesh and Lima 2019), or deceive the predator into searching for the wrong cues associated with the prey’s appearance (flash behavior, sensu Edmunds 1974)...Forty six years ago, Edmunds (1974) suggested that a predator “may be caused to hesitate by the sudden movement and appearance of the bright colour and it may follow this colour and be deceived by its sudden disappearance into assuming the prey has vanished whereas in reality the prey has come to rest in its normal cryptic posture with the coloured structures hidden”. Exhibiting a conspicuous part of the body while moving but hiding it when the animal becomes stationary is called flash behavior, and recent work shows that it confers an anti-predator advantage, at least in relation to “human predators.” Asking people to “catch” artificial prey moving across a computer screen demonstrated that prey appearing conspicuous during flight but inconspicuous when coming to rest were more difficult to locate than prey that were cryptic during flight (Loeffler-Henry et al. 2018). Furthermore, Bae et al. (2019) showed that artificial prey with larger and more conspicuous color patches were more difficult for people to locate on a screen when prey stopped moving. Flash behavior may possibly be facilitated by the “flash leg effect,” a visual illusion that occurs because of constraints in estimating the instantaneous position of moving object (Murali 2018). These studies with human subjects provide “proof of concept” of Edmunds’ assertion...Second, hidden contrasting signals are more likely to be found on larger species of Orthoptera, Phasmatidae, Mantidae, and Saturnidae, although not in Sphingidae (Loeffler-Henry et al. 2019). These results are in line with the finding using human subjects that flash behavior tends to be more effective in larger artificial prey. Lacking behavioral data, however, these comparative insect studies above cannot distinguish whether hidden conspicuous color patches are used during flight (flash behavior) or are exposed following provocation when the animal is stationary, thereby startling the predator (deimatic display, Holmes et al. 2018), but anecdotes are suggestive of flash behavior...Actually, some systematic comparative work has been conducted on both of these groups of mammals investigating conspicuous regions of the body (Caro and Stankowich 2009) both in relation to signaling to conspecifics and as pursuit deterrent signals (Stoner et al. 2003a, b) but not in relation to flash behavior because these studies principally focused on conspicuous body parts that are always on display...Here, using new data and phylogenetically controlled analyses, we re-examine these mammalian studies in order to test whether conspicuously colored regions of the body are (i) 44 Page 2 of 7 Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2020) 74: 4 used as intraspecific signals or (ii) for flash behavior.

When the wing of the male specimen of D. obscura is displayed on a white background with light from many different angles it appears clear or slightly stained (Fig. 2) while the same wing, when placed on a dark background with light parallel to the wing displays a bold and intricate WIP (Fig. 5D). Using a pinned museum specimen, we have demonstrated how quickly the WIP transmission can change with a change in background color (see Suppl. material 1: Movie S1). Given this, it is possible that crane flies are using WIP as a type of dynamic flash coloration (Murali 2018) to avoid predation. Additionally, erratic flight patterns have been found to increase the effectiveness of dynamic flash coloration to avoid predation (Murali and Kodandaramaiah 2020) and Pritchard (1983) notes both the wing pattern and the flight pattern of crane flies act to obfuscate the flies from predators.

"Dennis, R. L.

In this situation, .it is predicted that selection will enhance the primary defence function of the ventral wing surfaces, ensuring that adults are less apparent when at rest. Both Gonepteryx rhamni and Lepidae sinapsis have greener ventral hindwings in Ireland, and Aphantopus hyperantus, Coenonymphy tullia and C. pamphilus are paler on this surface. This, it is argued, enhances crypsis against resting backgrounds. However, apparent secondary defences on the ventral hindwing will be less of a handicap to insects which conceal themselves in dense vegetation when inactive. On the other hand, secondary defences on the dorsal surfaces and ventral forewing, hidden when the individual is completely inactive, may be enhanced as a result of selection for signals which induce a larger shock in predators, increasing evasion time for active insects close to the temperature threshold for activity (e.g. hlvous development and apical ocellus bipupillation in Maniola jurlina and Hipparchia semele; Dennis, 1977; Thomson, 1973, 1980).",0,0,"D, aids escape, shock",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,UK,"Shreeve, T.G.",,,,,,,,,1989,Herpetologica,Journal,"Butterfly wing morphology variation in the British Isles: the influence of climate, behavioural posture and the hostplant-habitat",invertebrates,,0,,no,0,0,0,,no,0,0,1,UK,no,0,1,0,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,no,0,0,no,no,no,yes,"Dennis, 1977; Thomson, 1973, 1980",m,0,1

"Edmunds, M.",no,"The defensive behaviour of 25 species of praying mantids from Ghana is described. All have camouflage as the primary defence mechanism, either a general resemblance to vegetation, or a specific resemblance to bark, sticks, leaves or grass. Secondary defence mechanisms include running, flying, thanatosis, secretion of fluid from the mouth, startle display and flash colouration...The secondary defensive adaptations discussed in this paper are running, flying, startle display, thanatosis (death-feigning), flash colouration, and chemical defence (regurgitation of fluids at the mouth)...Secondary defence. Both sexes may attempt to escape by running, or occasionally by flying, and both give a startle display very readily. This is a lateral display involving presentation of the brightly coloured inner surfaces of the forelegs towards the stimulus, opening of the wings, and showing the bright red and black marks on the jaws and intersegmentally on the ventral surface of the abdomen (Plate 1B). Further molestation causes the mantis to slash at the stimulus source. In the male the dorsal surface of the abdomen beneath the wings is red. Possibly this acts as a flash colouration since it vanishes when the insect alights after flying...Secondary defence. When attacked the males usually attempted to fly. Females, and sometimes the males too, responded by running with the wings raised thus exposing orange dorsally on the abdomen and purple on the hind wings. In the male the basal area of the hind wings is purple, the rest transparent; in the female the basal area is also purple, but the outer border is black. When the mantis comes to rest the wings are closed, and the colours vanish. It is likely that this is a form of flash colouration. No startle display could be elicited...The dorsal surface of the abdomen beneath the wings is dark red. This possibly acts as flash colouration when the insect flies...When the wings close these colours vanish, so it is possible that the function of the display in the female is a deceptive flash rather than to startle the predator...All species examined have crypsis as the first line of defence (primary defence), either by resembling the background in colour, or by a specific resemblance to part of the environment such as a stick or a blade of grass.

"Edmunds, M.",no,"Flash colors are colors that are exposed when an animal moves but are hidden when it is at rest, e.g., the bright hind wings of underwing moths (Catocala, Triphaena), hawkmoths (Macroglossum), and grasshoppers (Trilophidia, Oedipoda) all make the insect conspicuous while it is flying but as soon as it comes to rest and folds its hind wings beneath the cryptic forewings, the color vanishes. It is thought that predators may initially be startled when a hitherto cryptic insect is disturbed and flies off, suddenly exposing bright colors. The predator may then follow the bright color as it flies, preparing to attack it, but when it lands and the color vanishes the predator is baffled because it was following the color rather than the insect. This is how flash colors are thought to work; they certainly deceive humans in this way, so it is reasonable to suppose that birds also may be deceived, but there has been no experimental demonstration that they reduce predation by natural predators. Some butterflies have brightly colored upper sides to their fore wings which may be flash colors since these are hidden when the wings are folded together at rest. Other insects (e.g., some bugs and mantids) have bright colors (Fig. 54) on the dorsal surface of the abdomen which are hidden by the cryptically colored wings when at rest. These, too, may be flash colors. Many grasshoppers stridulate as they jump or fly and then remain silent on landing.

"Eisner, T.",no,"According to van der Weele (I908), male Ascalaphidae of the genera Byas and I-[aI)loglenius have a peculiar hinged flap covering the pronotum. The flap is more or less developed in different species, and in some conceals a bright pronotal patch. No mobility or function was ascribed to the flap. On November 17, 1968, while blacklighting at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Station, Barro Colorado Island, Canal Zone, one of us (T.E.) had occasion to observe the response to manipulation of a male of Haologlenius luteus that had come to rest at the light. Every time the insect was poked or seized, it abruptly .exposed its patch, which in this species is brilliantly white-pruinose and contrasts sharply with the drab remainder of the body (Figs. 1-3). We suggest that this ""flashing"" behavior is defensive in function. Whether it merely startles predators or serves also as reinforcement of distastefulness cannot be said, since nothing is known about the palatability of Hal)loglenius (some ascalaphids have a bad stench and may be distasteful). The startling function need not be the only, or for that matter primary, function of the flap.

"Emberts, Z.",no,"Hidden contrasting color patterns are found in species that are inconspicuously colored while at rest, but, when disturbed or in motion, reveal hidden coloration that may ward off predators. These signals can be divided into two main defenses, flash displays and deimatic displays. A flash display is the use of otherwise concealed contrasting color signals while in motion (Edmunds, 2008). This defense may be effective in evading predation by confusing the predator of its location, making it difficult to estimate its future trajectory (Loeffler-Henry, Kang, Yip, Caro, & Sherratt, 2018; Murali, 2018). It is hypothesized that flash displays may also function to frighten or surprise predators, causing them to abandon or be unsuccessful in their pursuit (Murali, 2018). These displays can be seen in the colorful underwings of a variety of moths, namely sphingid and noctuid moths, as well as the hindwings of some orthopterans, mantids, and cicadas (LoefflerHenry, Kang, & Sherratt, 2019...Within this clade, there are at least two hidden color displays, a black and white patch color pattern and red/orange coloration (Figure 1). There is strong evidence to suggest that both a black and white color pattern and red/orange coloration can have antipredatory benefits (Cott, 1940; Ruxton, Sherratt, & Speed, 2004). In leaf-footed bugs, these warning displays are found on the dorsal side of their abdomen. The location of these warning displays is important because this portion of the body is often concealed (Figure 1). When leaf-footed bugs, and hemipterans in general, are in their resting state (i.e., non-flying state), they fold their wings over their abdomen. As a result, the color and coloration patterns on the forewings are most frequently observed (Figure 1). However, when individuals transition their wings into their flying position a new color pattern is revealed. Since these visual signals are behaviorally dynamic, as opposed to always being displayed, they fall within the hidden contrasting color display framework (Skelhorn, Holmes, & Rowe, 2016; Umbers et al., 2015; Umbers & Mappes, 2016). Moreover, because their hidden color is only revealed while in flight, these are flash displays...We found that larger species of leaf-footed bugs are more likely to have flash displays that reveal white patches on a black background (Figure 5)...It could also be argued that this inconsistency is driven by the conspicuousness of the flash displays, that is, how well the signal stands out within a given environment...That is to say, it is quite rare for a leaf-footed bug to autotomize its hind limb quickly and to have a flash display...",0,0,"ITP, but more like ASP?",0,0,1,0,1,1,fear,USA,"Miller, C.

As a very typical and often discussed pat­tern in the mimids (Horwich 1965), this intention movement was first reported in an Old World species (Erythropygia ieucophrys) of the Group by Monroe (1964). Subsequently, the author observed it in all other members of this genus occurring south of the Zambezi and believes this movement features also in the other species of this genus occurring in the rest of Africa, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is also a typical pattern of the behaviour of Chaetops frenatus; in the hand-reared young wing-flashing first appeared, and immediately in its complete form, on the 129th day after hatching (a male showed it off on an unexpected encounter with the author's dog). Wing­ flashing in Chaetops is in no way different from that which the author has observed in Erythropygia spp and in Mimus poiygiottos where in all cases it consisted of running -then suddenly stopping with a synchronous flash­ing of the wings -running, etc. This probably also occurs in Pinarornis piumosus and Mystacornis crossieyi, but is lacking in Cichiadusa spp...On the strength of the avail­able evidence wing-flashing must be rated high as a very constant ancestral character which certainly does not represent any ad hoc type adaptation ('Darwin's Principle') and is also highly consistent because it is lacking in both timaliine and turdine birds.",0,1,interaction with dog,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,South Africa,,,,,,,,,,1984,Proceedings of the fifth pan African ornithological congress,Conference papers,"Taxonomic features common to Mimidae, Erythropygia and some other genera",invertebrates,,0,,no,0,0,0,,no,0,0,0,,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,1,wing-flashing/flashing,no,1,0,no,no,no,no,no,no,1,0

Moreover, it is also warningly coloured (p. 250 ).

"Glaw, F.",no,"After capturing the frog by hand, it did not try to jump away, but displayed a distinct posture, which can be interpreted as an anti-predator behaviour: It bent its head and body to form a convex dorsal surface, closed its eyes, partly covered the anterior head and the eyes by its hands, and folded its limbs in front of its belly (Fig. 1c-e). Due to this ball-like posture the frog had “turned off” the adhesion of its feet to the underground and could easily fall down from the hand. In a natural situation, this behaviour might help the frog to escape a potential predator by falling down from the tree. In addition, this posture effectively dissolved the natural shape of the frog and made the orange-yellow ventral surfaces visible. This sudden dynamic change in striking vs. cryptic colouration during the falling might serve to protect the frog from predation by misrepresenting the prey’s moving location due to the neural processing delay in predators caused by the flash lag effect and by displaying a different and contrasting colouration in comparison to that of the resting posture (Murali 2018, Loeffler-Henry et al. 2018).

This includes such strategies as decoy coloration (Watson et al., 2012; Wilkinson, 2003), flash coloration (Bae et al., 2019; Murali, 2018), motion-dazzle coloration (Murali & Kodandaramaiah, 2017; Stevens et al., 2011), aposematism (Mappes et al., 2005; Rojas et al., 2015), masquerade (Allen & Cooper, 1985; Skelhorn et al., 2010), and crypsis (Ruxton et al., 2004).",0,1,no,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,"Watson, C.

"Pipek, P.",no,"Aim of the present study was to test antipredatory function of fulguration (or flash display), which means sudden exposition of conspicous body part on otherwise cryptic animal during escape..2.1.3 Fulguration During fulguration, striking color appears simultaneously with take-off (e.g. in locusts, Figure 2.2), after landing the animal returns to its original cryptic appearance. The resulting effect resembles a flash, therefore according to Komárek (2004) the term fulguration is used for this type of behavior (Latin fulgur is a flash), while Cott (1940) uses the term flash display for the same phenomenon, which also refers to a flash (English flash is lightning). Sometimes there is even a series of flashes during flight, when a significant part of the body is alternately covered and revealed by the movement of the wings (Štys & Exnerová 2003). The flight itself can have a highly unpredictable trajectory (Humphries & Driver 1970), or at least a surprising direction (Cooper 2006). In addition, the color change is often accompanied by acoustic and olfactory signals (Cott 1940), which can be perceived even more strongly than visual signals (Roper & Marples 1997). I will return to this in the next section. As an answer to the question of how fulguration can increase the prey's chance of survival, a number of hypotheses have been proposed...2.2 Anti-predation functions of fulguration 2.2.1 Scaring off a predator Fulguration is usually thought to slow down or deter a predator attack by scaring or intimidating it (Ruxton et al. 2004). Even a short hesitation could give the prey enough head start to escape to safety. Schlenoff (1985) names the characteristics of a stimulus that can cause a startle response: 1) novelty (novelties), 2) unusualness (oddities), 3) salience, 4) anomaly (unexpected stimulus). In some predators, the combination of these characteristics can awaken an innate fear of the new - neophobia (for an excellent summary of this issue, see Beranová 2010) or evoke reminiscences of unpleasant experiences with some aposematics. It is necessary to emphasize once again that everything happens at high speed, so the predator does not have much time to make a decision. If the warning signal is not true, i.e. if it does not carry information about real danger, there is a risk that the predator will stop responding to it when repeatedly encountering this signal (Sargent 1981). In order for the signal to remain effective and at the same time allow the species to reach larger populations, it is necessary to somehow prevent the predator from habituating to the signal. This can be achieved in several ways.

"Schoen, M.",yes,"When spreading and folding the wing (and tail) during active flight, markings contrasting to the rest of the feathers may generate a flashing signal...As a result, narrow parts of feathers contrasting strongly with the rest of the feather may generate a strong flashing signal which is conspicuous mainly because it is visible for just a short “glimpse”: conspicuousness caused by short-period visibility (cf. BURTT 1986)...Flashing signals are widespread in animals, e.g. in mammals such as antelopes, deer, and squirrels (with contrasting colouration of the underside, or rear side, or tail), and in insects such as grasshoppers (Oedipoda, Psophus with coloured hind wings), moths (Noctua, Smerinthus with the contrasting pattern of the hind wings), acting as intraspecific or deterrent signals. In butterflies, dynamic colour signals may be generated by flicker movements of iridescent wings which show a specific arrangement and nano-structure of the reflectory micro-elements, i.e. scales (Morpho: VUKUSIC et al. 1999, YOSHIOKA & KINOSHITA 2004, Ancyluris: VUKUSIC et al. 2002; summarized in: KINOSHITA & YOSHIOKA 2005). In lizards, flashing signals (of the throat fan) may be part of the intraspecific signalling system, with the intensity of reaction strongly depending on the velocity contrast of the motion pattern against the background vegetation movement (Anolis: FLEISHMAN 1992, PERSONS et al. 1999; cf. PETERS et al. 2008)...Furthermore, the flashing signal may be reinforced by repetition of the pattern on adjacent feathers of the same unit (cf. Fig. 5). Thus in greenfinches, siskins and linnets ([Carduelis] superspecies; Fig. 6), the lighter wing-stripe area is subdivided by darker longitudinal stripes, e.g. dark shafts, and the complete pattern is visible only during a very short period when the wing is maximally spread and adjacent feathers are maximally apart from each other. In woodpeckers Picoides (Dendrocopos; partly in Picus and Colaptes too), a dynamic optical signal is formed by several rows of white (light) dots contrasting with the black (dark) background colour of the large wing feathers (cf. BLUME 1977, WINKLER et al. 1995). Because the dots are separated from each other on every single feather, and separated from the dots on adjacent feathers, a flashing signal is generated during every wing stroke, with most dots being visible for short periods only. In small passerines, the innermost part of the wing just distal to the tertials (cf. Fig. 5) — may be visible for a few milliseconds only (1-10 msec, estimated from series of photographs of flying birds). Despite this very short opportunity “to catch a glimpse”, such a dynamically generated signal may be more conspicuous because the signal is switched on and rapidly switched off again: conspicuousness caused by switching on and off!",0,1,switching on and off,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Germany,,,,,,,,,,2009,Ethology Ecology & Evolution,Journal,Why birds should communicate by dynamic optical signal patterns and not by the static signals perceived by man,birds,,0,,no,0,0,0,,no,0,0,0,,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,1,"flashing signal, flashing pattern, ""flashing"" effect","cf.

Predators may be startled by the sudden exposure of a novel, contrasting coloration when the insect spreads its wings (Edmunds 1974; Sargent 1981).

"Short, L.

Within Colaptes melanochloros, the partly terrestrial melanolaimus group has a whitish rump and a gold breast patch, whereas the arboreal C. m. melanochloros has no rump patch and no breast patch. These patterns may serve as warning signals, or otherwise in communication with conspecific individuals while the birds are in flight as well as during courtship and aggressive displays. These markings ordinarily are not visible, and the dull pattern of their upper parts then affords protection by blending with the earth and grass in which they feed...Selection from predation seems responsible at least partly for the shift to brown coloration, the strong tendency toward barring and streaking, the reduction of conspicuous colors and markings dorsally, the reduction of sexual markings, and the development and enhancement of ""flash"" signals. These signals probably also are favored by long-distance visibility in open country...In addition to ""flash"" colors, which become conspicuous only during displays, are special movements such as wing-flicking (see fig. 7), which are more prevalent in ground-dwelling flickers (e.g., in Colaptes campestris) than in their semiterrestrial relatives.",0,1,"no predation pressure for selection, warning",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,,,,,,,,,,1971,Chemical Defenses of Arthropods,Journal,The evolution of terrestrial woodpeckers,birds,,0,,no,0,0,1,US,no,1,0,0,,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,0,no,0,0,1,"Flash signals, flash patterns, flash color patterns",no,0,1,no,no,no,yes?,no,m,1,1

The problem of finding the stationary cryptic prey could be further exacerbated if the predator predicts the movement of the prey along the perceived trajectory, and searches in the wrong place, either because it looks further along the path than where the prey has actually stopped [17], or less far because of misjudging the speed [33].",0,0,ASP and ITP Cott and Edmunds,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,Italy,"Read, J.

"Williams, S.

These so-called flash markings are normally vivid and contrast with the dorsal colouration. When the frog is threatened it leaps, suddenly temporarily exposing the flash markings to startle the predator. When the frog lands it assumes its resting posture, concealing the bright colouration and presenting only the possibly cryptically coloured dorsal surfaces (Duellman and Trueb, 1994, Stebbins and Cohen, 1995)...The use of brightly coloured areas of the body as flash markings to startle predators has been reported in several species including anurans (Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998, Duellman and Trueb, 1994). It is possible that the bright iris of the Agalychnis frogs is used in the same way. All species of Agalychnis are capable of concealing their bright iris colour when at rest, and exposing the bright colour quickly. A bright iris for use as flash markings may be a useful anti-predator mechanism, but these bright colours must only be revealed when appropriate, to avoid making the animals more conspicuous. If bright eye colouration is used as an anti-predator flash marking system, this could explain why young A. calcarifer are able to expose relatively greater area of bright colouration than adults, as young animals are more susceptible to predators than adults. They therefore often have better anti-predator mechanisms than at later developmental stages (Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998)...contrast with the dorsal colouration. When the frog is threatened it leaps, suddenly temporarily exposing the flash markings to startle the predator.
